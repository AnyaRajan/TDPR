# TDPR: Prioritize Test Inputs for DNNs Using Training Dynamic
## Structure
- models: implementations of DNNs studied in TDPR
- data: the file used to save nomianl datasets and corrupted datasets
- results: experimental data including results of preliminary study and experiments
## Usage
We prepare a demo for TDPR, which uses results on corrupted test data (type=gaussian_noise) from Cifar-10-C.

`python demo.py`

If you want to run our code, please download the corrsponding datasets and run following code:

`python TDPR.py`
